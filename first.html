          <h2><strong>What's Happening in Kashmir?!</strong></h2>
          <p><strong>August 5,2019; </strong> A day to be remembered by the Indian parliament, as one of the historic act took place. Yes, on this day abrogation of article 370 and 35a took place . Soon enough it became the latest topic of debate until today. PM Modi's and minister Amit Shah's words were rated the top tweets of the day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So before elaborating the two sides, let's have a glance what article 370 and article 35a says:</p>
                    <p><b>Article 370: </b> Article 370 of the Indian constitution, gave special status to Jammu And Kashmir, allowing the state to have a separate state flag, separate constitution and autonomy over internal administration of the state.</p>
                    <p><b>Article 35a: </b>Whereas article 35a , in a way linked to article 370, defined that the residents lived in a separate set of laws including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights compared to other states.</p>
                    <p>In simple words this is what the two articles meant</p><br>

                    <br>
                    <p><i>SIDE 1: <br></i> How did it benefit the people outside the state?
<br>1. Now the people from other states can buy property. <br>So bigger companies can now invest , and this will boost the economy of the state.
<br>2. Diversification the environment.
<br>3. End of dual citizenship.<br>
<br><i>SIDE 2:<br> </i>What about kashmiris?</p>
<p>While we were busy posting words regarding article 370 in social, some of them with it , and some of them against, did we actually care for the sentiments of kashmiris?
Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A which was supposed to be discussed with Kashmiris, was it really successful?<br>Even though we knew the kashmiris had been living in a sensitive and isolated environment for decades, then why this decision all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Right now, Kashmiris are held in curfew, communications blocked, residents are not allowed to assemble in groups. They're confined to live within their houses. Their lives right now is not less than in a prison. Even more disgusting act, was that "MARRY KASHMIRI GIRLS" became one of the most searched on google on a particular day after an MLA worded that "Now they can marry kashmiri girls". Even I'm disgusted by this comment. And more problematic is that the pakistanis are trying to win the kashmiris.</p>
<p>This is not yet darkness, the light is still dim. Article 370 and 35a has more side effects than rate of cure. We cannot sacrifice the most essential part to live.
This is just my view from the sources i've collected which i've found as much as accurate. But as we know the 80% of the truth is still behind the scenes.</p>
